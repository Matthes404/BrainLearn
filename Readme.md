## Overview

BrainLearn is a free, powerful UCI chess engine derived from BrainFish ([https://zipproth.de/Brainfish/download/](https://zipproth.de/Brainfish/download/)). It is not a complete chess program and requires a UCI-compatible GUI (e.g. XBoard with PolyGlot, Scid, Cute Chess, eboard, Arena, Sigma Chess, Shredder, Chess Partner or Fritz) in order to be used comfortably. Read the documentation for your GUI of choice for information about how to use Stockfish with it.

## Files

This distribution of BrainLearn consists of the following files:

- Readme.md, the file you are currently reading.
- Copying.txt, a text file containing the GNU General Public License version 3.
- src, a subdirectory containing the full source code, including a Makefile that can be used to compile BrainLearn on Unix-like systems.

## UCI parameters

BrainLearn hash the same options as BrainFish, but it implements a persisted learning algorithm, managing a file named experience.bin.

It is a collection of one or more positions stored with the following format (similar to in memory Stockfish Transposition Table):

- _best move_
- _board signature (hash key)_
- _best move depth_
- _best move score_
- _best move performance_ , a new parameter you can calculate with any learning application supporting this specification. An example is the private one, kernel of SaaS part of [ChessProbe](http://www.chessprobe.com) AI portal. The idea is to calculate it based on pattern recognition concept. In the portal, you can also exploit the reports of another NLG (virtual trainer) application and buy the products in the digishop based on all this. This open-source part has the performance default. So, it doesn't use it. Clearly, even if already strong, this private learning algorithm is a lot stronger as demostrate here: [Graphical result](https://github.com/amchess/BrainLearn/tree/master/tests/6-5.jpg)

This file is loaded in an hashtable at the engine load and updated each time the engine receive quit or stop uci command.
When BrainLearn starts a new game or when we have max 8 pieces on the chessboard, the learning is activated and the hash table updated each time the engine has a best score
at a depth >= 4 PLIES, according to Stockfish aspiration window.

At the engine loading, there is an automatic merge to experience.bin files, if we put the other ones, based on the following convention:

&lt;fileType&gt;&lt;qualityIndex&gt;.bin

where

- _fileType=&quot;experience&quot;/&quot;bin&quot;_
- _qualityIndex_ , an integer, incrementally from 0 on based on the file&#39;s quality assigned by the user (0 best quality and so on)

N.B.

Because of disk access, to be effective, the learning must be made at no bullet time controls (less than 5 minutes/game).

#### Contempt
The default value is 0 and keep it for analysis purpose. For game playing, you can use the default stockfish value 24

#### Dynamic contempt

_Boolean, Default: True_ For match play, activate it and the engine uses the dynamic contempt. For analysis purpose; keep it at its default, to completely avoid, with contempt settled to 0, the well known [rollercoaster effect](http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=69129) and align so the engine's score to the gui's informator symbols

### Read only learning

_Boolean, Default: False_ 
If activated, the learning file is only read.

### Self Q-learning

_Boolean, Default: False_ 
If activated, the learning algorithm is the [Q-learning](https://youtu.be/qhRNvCVVJaA?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xoWNVdDudn51XM8lOuZ_Njv), optimized for self play. Some GUIs don't write the experience file in some game's modes because the uci protocol is differently implemented

### Live Book section (thanks to Eman's author Khalid Omar for windows builds)

#### Live Book (checkbox)

_Boolean, Default: False_ If activated, the engine uses the livebook as primary choice.

#### Live Book URL
The default is the online [chessdb](https://www.chessdb.cn/queryc_en/), a wonderful project by noobpwnftw (thanks to him!)
 
[https://github.com/noobpwnftw/chessdb](https://github.com/noobpwnftw/chessdb)

[http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=71764&hilit=chessdb](http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=71764&hilit=chessdb)

The private application can also learn from this live db.

#### Live Book Timeout

_Default 5000, min 0, max 10000_ Only for bullet games, use a lower value, for example, 1500.

#### Live Book Retry

_Default 3, min 1, max 100_ Max times the engine tries to contribute (if the corresponding option is activated: see below) to the live book. If 0, the engine doesn't use the livebook.

#### Live Book Diversity

_Boolean, Default: False_ If activated, the engine varies its play, reducing conversely its strength because already the live chessdb is very large.

#### Live Book Contribute

_Boolean, Default: False_ If activated, the engine sends a move, not in live chessdb, in its queue to be analysed. In this manner, we have a kind of learning cloud.

#### Live Book Depth

_Default 100, min 1, max 100_ Depth of live book moves.

### Opening variety

_Integer, Default: 0, Min: 0, Max: 40_
To play different opening lines from default (0), if not from book (see below).
Higher variety -> more probable loss of ELO

## pgn_to_bl_converter

Converting pgn to brainlearn format is really simple.

Requirements
1. Download cuteChess gui
2. Download brainlearn
3. Download stockfish or equivalent
3. Download the pgn files you want to convert

In Cute Chess, set a tournament according to the photo in this link:
[CuteChess Settings](https://github.com/amchess/BrainLearn/tree/master/doc/pgn_to_bl.PNG)

- Add the 2 engines (One should be brainlearn)

-start a tournament with brainlearn and any other engine. It will convert all the games in the pgn file and save them to game.bin

Note: We recommend you use games from high quality play.
